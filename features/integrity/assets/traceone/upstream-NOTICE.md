# Third-party notice

TraceOne includes and adapts the ModelTrace feature extractor, reference bank,
and reference corpus from commit `3f0dd2f4b451ad424f3b165a108a468efe4d4d81`.

The seven-route release additionally incorporates ModelTrace's updated 16-model
reference corpus and bank from commit
`55a2e4a55170423b484d701e9a82ab62b268c811`. Both pinned snapshots remain
in this repository so the historical five-route result can still be audited.

ModelTrace is not merely a comparator: it is the direct intellectual and
implementation foundation of TraceOne. We gratefully recognize the originality,
clarity, reproducibility, and generosity of xqy2006's open-source contribution.

TraceOne's guard layer, one-response protocol, grouped evaluation, provenance
capture, and paired degradation test are separate additions. The inclusion of
ModelTrace data does not make the two projects' published metrics directly
comparable.
